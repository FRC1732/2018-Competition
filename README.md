# 2018-Competition-Bot

This is the repository for the 2018 competition bot code.

There is NO code in the main branch.
Instead, please switch to the `competition-production` branch to get the final competition code. This code is garenteed to work, so you will not be pushing code to the `competition-production` branch at any time.

If you will be pushing new code, switch to the `competition-testing` branch. Submit a pull request to have your code moved into the production branch. If you intend to work on an involved autonomous code, you should create your own branch from `competition-testing` to keep your code. When your auto is done, it can be pull requested into the testing branch, and tehn into the production branch.

The practice branches are intended to hold a copy of the competition branches, but instead intended for the practice robot, instead of the competition robot.
